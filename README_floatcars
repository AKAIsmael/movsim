Hello Chourok,

I assume you speak of MovSim (www.movsim.org)

1. If you have different scenarios (different models, parameters, initial or boundary conditions) iut is best to create a new simulation project for each scenario. In the simplest case, just copy the <project>.xprj and the <project>.xodr files to  <projectNew>.xprj and <projectNew>.xod, and change whatever is different in the new project. Then all output will be to files named <projectNew>.* which you can compare with <project>.*

2. in the .xprj file, there is a section <FloatingCarOutput ...> ... </FloatingCarOutput>
where you can specify which single vehicles are recorded. For example, the section

<FloatingCarOutput n_timestep="5" route="main">
<FloatingCar number="2" />
<FloatingCar number="11" />
</FloatingCarOutput>

will record Car 2 and Car 11 of the route/road segment "main" (the first car has the lowest index)

I hope this will help you

Martin
